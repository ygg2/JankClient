# Jank Client
Jank Client is a [Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat) Client written in TS, HTML, and CSS.

To run it, clone the repo and do `npm install`, then
`node index.js`
or do the equivalent with bun

Both [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) are supported, and should function as expected.

To access Jank Client after starting, simply go to http://localhost:8080/login and either register a new account, or log in with your email and password.

If there are any issues please report them either here, or to me dirrectly on spacebar
